Pre-compiled binary executables are not provided now that the 
dependent libraries are no longer statically linked. Please see the 
documentation on building the supplemental libraries and building GrADS 
from source at http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/supplibs2.html

After a successful build, the executables in the ./bin directory  
are typically placed in a public directory such as /usr/local/bin. 
If you do not have write permission for /usr/local/bin, you can put 
them in a subdirectory under $HOME.  

The shared object files in the ./lib directory may be left in place or 
moved to a public directory such as /usr/local/lib/. Use the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to their location. 

GrADS will looks for a default file called "updt" in the directory named 
by the GADDIR environment variable. The udpt file contains the full path 
to the shared object files, along with other information that GrADS needs. 
Please see documentation http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/udpt.html

A successfull build will place the following executables in the ./bin directory:

 bufrscan         Reads BUFR messages and prints out ascii values 
 grads            GrADS - The basic package
 grib2scan        Extracts grid info from a GRIB2 data set
 gribmap          Creates an index file that "maps" a GRIB data set for a GrADS descriptor file
 gribscan         Extracts grid info from a GRIB data set
 stnmap           Maps station data

The following shared object files (and their symlinks) will be in the ./lib directory

 libgxdCairo      Cairo graphics display plug-in
 libgxpCairo      Cairo graphics printing plugin
 libgxdX11        Classic X11 display plug-in
 libgxpGD         Classic GD printing plug-in
 libgxdummy       A no-op dummy graphics display and printing plug-in
 libgradspy       The GrADS executable plug-in that is loaded by the GradsPy start method

To install GradsPy, the Python interface to GrADS, you must be using Python3.
Please see the documentation at http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/python.html

The .data/ directory contains the GrADS fonts, map files, and udunits files that are
required for running GrADS. A tarball is also available at ftp://cola.gmu.edu/grads/data3.tar.gz. 
The default location is /usr/local/lib/grads/. If you do not have write permission for 
/usr/local/lib/grads, you can place the files elsewhere, but you must also change the 
environment variable GADDIR so the GrADS executables will know where to find these files.

     cd dirname
     tar xvfz data3.tar.gz
     setenv GADDIR dirname (If dirname is not /usr/local/lib/grads)
