The executables contained in the ./bin directory of the distribution tarfile 
are typically placed in a public directory such as /usr/local/bin. 
If you do not have write permission for /usr/local/bin, you can put them 
in a subdirectory under $HOME -- e.g. /home/username/bin/. 

The shared object files in the ./lib directory of the distribution tarfile may be 
placed anywhere that is convenient. GrADS will looks for a default file called "updt" 
in the directory named by the GADDIR environment variable. The udpt file contains the 
full path to the shared object files, along with other information that GrADS needs. 
Please see documentation http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/udpt.html


The following executables are in the ./bin directory:

 bufrscan         Reads BUFR messages and prints out ascii values 
 grads            GrADS - The basic package
 grib2scan        Extracts grid info from a GRIB2 data set
 gribmap          Creates an index file that "maps" a GRIB data set for a GrADS descriptor file
 gribscan         Extracts grid info from a GRIB data set
 stnmap           Maps station data

The following shared object files (and their symlinks) are in the ./lib directory

 libgxdCairo      Cairo graphics display plug-in
 libgxpCairo      Cairo graphics printing plugin
 libgxdX11        Classic X11 display plug-in
 libgxpGD         Classic GD printing plug-in
 libgxdummy       A no-op dummy graphics display and printing plug-in


A second tar file (data2.tar.gz) contains the GrADS fonts and maps data sets is 
also necessary and can be downloaded from http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/downloads.php

The contents of this file are typically placed in the directory
/usr/local/lib/grads, the default location for these files. If you do not have
write permission for /usr/local/lib/grads, you can place the files elsewhere, but
you must also change the environment variable GADDIR so the GrADS executables will
know where to find these files.

     cd dirname
     tar xvfz data2.tar.gz
     setenv GADDIR dirname (If dirname is not /usr/local/lib/grads)
