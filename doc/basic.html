The three fundamental GrADS  commands: </p><ol>  <li><code>open</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    open or make available to GrADS a data file    with    either gridded or station data </li>  <li><code>d</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  display a GrADS    &quot;expression&quot; (e.g., a slice of data) </li>  <li><code>set</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  manipulate the &quot;what&quot; &quot;where&quot; and    &quot;how&quot; of data    display</li></ol><p> The GrADS &quot;expression,&quot; or what you want to look at, can be as  simple as a variable in the data file that was opened, e.g., <code>d    slp</code> or an arithmetic or GrADS function operation on the data,  e.g., <code>d slp/100</code> or <code>d mag(u,v)</code> where mag is a GrADS intrinsic  function.</p><p> The &quot;where&quot; of data display is called the &quot;dimension environment&quot;  and defines which part, chunk or &quot;hyperslab&quot; of the 5-D   geophysical space (lon,lat,level,time,ens) is displayed.  The  dimension environment is manipulated through the <a href="commands.html#setdimension">set</a> command and  is controlled in either grid coordinates (x,y,z,t,e  indices) or <i>world</i> coordinates (<code>lon, lat, lev, time</code>, ens).</p><p> The &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of display is also controlled by the  <a href="commands.html"><code>set</code></a> command and  includes both graphics methods (e.g., contours, streamlines) and  data (e.g., <code>d</code> to a file).</p><p> GrADS graphics can be written to a file (i.e., <code><ahref="gradcomdenableprint.html">enable print</a> <i>filename</i></code> and <ahref="gradcomdprint.html"><code>print</code></a>)  and then converted to postscript for  printing  and/or conversion to other image formats.</p><p> In addition, GrADS includes graphic primitives (e.g., lines and  circles) and basic labelling through the <a href="commands.html#draw"><code>draw    command</code></a>.</p><p> The <code><a href="gradcomdquery.html">q</a></code> or <a href="gradcomdquery.html"><code>query</code></a> command is used to get information from GrADS  such  as which files are opened and even statistics. </p></td>  </tr></table><h1>&nbsp;</h1>
