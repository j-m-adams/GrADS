The three arguments to <code>vint</code> are: <p><code><i>psexpr</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>a GrADS expression for thesurface pressure, in mb, which bounds the integral onthe bottom. <br><code><i>expr</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>a GrADS expression representing the quantity to be integrated.<br><code><i>top</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>the bounding top pressure, in mb. This value must be a constant and cannot beprovided as an expression. <p>The calculation is a sum of the mass-weighted layers: <p><ul><code>f/g * sum(expr * Delta(level))</code></ul><p>The bounds of the integration are the surface pressure and theindicated <code><i>top</i></code> value. The scale factors are f=100and g=9.8. The summation is done for each layer present that isbetween the bounds. The layers are determined by the Z levels of thedefault file. Each layer is considered to be from the midpointsbetween the levels actually present, and is assumed to have the samevalue throughout the layer, namely the value of the gridpoint at themiddle of the layer.<p><h3>Usage Notes </h3><p><ol><li>The summation is done using the Z levels from the default file, so it is important that the default file have the same Z dimensioncoordinates as <code><i>expr</i></code>.<li>Data levels below and above the bounds of the summation are ignored.<li>The Z dimension in world-coordinate units is assumed to bepressure values given in millibars (mb).  The units of g aresuch that when the expression integrated is specific humidity (q) inunits of g/g, the result is kg of water per square meter, orprecipitable water in mm. <li>It is usually a good idea to make the <code><i>top</i></code>pressure value to be at the top of a layer, which is midway betweengrid points. For example, if the default file (and the data) havepressure levels of ...,500,400,300,250,... then a good value for<code><i>top</i></code> might be 275, the value at the top of thelayer that extends from 350 to 275 mb. <li>The <code>vint</code> function operates only in an X-Y varyingdimension environment. <li>Be sure the units of the surface pressure (argument 1) are in millibars (mb).  <p></ol><p><h3>Examples </h3><p><p>1. This expression will integrate specific humidity to obtainprecipitable water, in mm:<ul><code>vint(ps,q,275)</code></ul><p> 2. This is an artificial example that demonstrates a vertical integration from a fixed lower bound of 1000mb to the top of the atmosphere, and integrating a field of all 1's. This gives an answer of 10204.1 (or 100000/9.8) which is the mass of air (in kg) of a 1 meter squared column when the surface pressure is 1 bar and the accelleration due to gravity is assumed to be exactly 9.8m/sec**2 over the entire column.<ul>  <code>vint(const(ps,1000),const(t,1),0)</code></ul><p></body></html>
