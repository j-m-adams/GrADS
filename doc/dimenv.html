Expressions are evaluated with respectto the dimension environment (which allows for simplicity in theexpression syntax), and the final display will be determined bythe dimension environment.  Thus, the dimension environment is aGrADS concept that is important to understand.<p>The dimension environment is manipulated by the user by enteringone of the following set commands:<p><dd><code><a href="gradcomdsetlatlonlevtimeens.html">set lat|lon|lev|time|ens</a> <i>val1&lt;val2&gt;</i></code>  <p>This set command sets one dimension of the dimension environmentusing world coordinates.<p>Alternatively:<p><dd><code><a href="gradcomdsetxyzte.html">set x|y|z|t|e</a><i> val1&lt;val2&gt;</i></code>  <p>This sets one dimension of the dimension environment using gridcoordinates.  You may use whatever coordinates are convenient toyou.  Issuing <code><a href="gradcomdsetlatlonlevtimeens.html">set lon</a></code> isequivalent to issuing <code><a href="gradcomdsetxyzte.html">set x</a></code>, bothset the x dimension.  The difference is only the units you wishto enter the command in.<p>When you enter just one value, that dimension is said to be"fixed".  When you enter two values, that dimension is said to be"varying".  The combination of fixed and varying dimensionsdefines the dimension environment.<p>Examples:<p><ul><code><a href="gradcomdsetlatlonlevtimeens.html">set lon</a> -1800</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  setslongitude to vary from 180W to 0<br><code><a href="gradcomdsetlatlonlevtimeens.html">set lat</a> 090</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setslatitude to vary from the equator to 90N<br><code><a href="gradcomdsetlatlonlevtimeens.html">set lev</a>500</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setsthe level to 500mb - a fixed dimension<br> <code><a href="gradcomdsetxyzte.html">set t</a>1</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sets time to the first time in the data set--using gridcoordinates in this case. Time is now a fixed dimension</ul><p>When <b>all</b> dimensions are fixed, you are referring to a <b>single</b> datapoint.<p>When <b>one</b> dimension is varying, you are referring to a <b>1-D "slice"</b>through the data set.<p>When <b>two</b> dimensions are varying, you are referring to a <b>2-D"slice"</b> through the data set.<p>When <b>three or more</b> dimension vary, GrADS interprets this as a <b>sequence of2-D slices</b>.<p><b>An important note:</b>  When you specificy the dimension environment in terms of  gridcoordinates, they are always converted to world coordinates. This conversion  requires some knowledge of what scaling is inuse for grid to world conversions.  The scaling that is used inall cases (except one) is the scaling of the <i>default file</i>. Theexception is when you supply a dimension expression within avariable specification, which will be covered later.
