<H2><B>set cterp</B></H2><P>
<code>set cterp <i>on|off</i></code><p>
Turns spline smoothing on or off. "Sticks" until reset. Shaded contours
are drawn without spline fitting, so to insure an exact match when
overlaying contour lines and shaded contours of the same field, specify
<code>cterp</code> as off. You can still use the
<a href="gradcomdsetcsmooth.html"><code>csmooth</code></a>
option, which affects both contour lines and shaded contours.<p>
