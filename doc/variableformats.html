Before continuing, it is recommended that you review the material in these other sections:<ul><li><a href="aboutgriddeddata.html">About GrADS Gridded Data Sets</a><li><a href="descriptorfile.html">Elements of a GrADS Data Descriptor File</a></ul><p>In a GrADS data descriptor file each variable declaration recordhas the following syntax:<p><ul><code><i>varname levs units description</i></code></ul><p>The <a href="descriptorfile.html#VARS">VARS</a> section of <ahref="descriptorfile.html">Elements of a GrADS Data DescriptorFile</a> explains the general syntax of the variable declarationrecord. This section goes into further detail on the use of the<code><i>units</i></code> keyword to invoke some special features thatallow GrADS to read binary files that do not conform to the defaultstructure.<p>The structure of a 3-D or 4-D data set is determined by the order inwhich the horizonal grids are written to file. The default sequencegoes in the following order starting from the fastest varyingdimension to the slowest varying dimension: longitude (X), latitude(Y), vertical level (Z), variable (VAR), time (T). <p>If your binary data set was created or "packed" according to adifferent dimension sequence, then you can use the<code><i>units</i></code> keyword to tell GrADS exactly how to unpackthe data. The <code><i>units</i></code> keyword is actually a seriesof one or more comma-delimited numbers. If <code><i>units</i></code>is set to <code>99</code> then all the features for unpacking specialdata formats are ignored. If <code><i>units</i></code> is set to<code>-1</code>, then the features are invoked via additionalparameters that follow the <code>-1</code> and are separated bycommas:<p><ul><code><i>units</i> = -1, <i>structure</i> &lt;,arg&gt;</i></code></ul><p>There are four options for <code><i>structure</i></code>, outlinedbelow.  Some of these options have additional attributes which arespecified with <code><i>arg</i></code>.<p><ol><li><code><i>units</i> = -1,10,1</code><p><span class="style1">This option was removed in GrADS version 2.0. </span>This option indicates that "VAR" and "Z" have been transposed in thedimension sequence. The order is: longitude (X), latitude (Y),variable (VAR), vertical level (Z), time(T). Thus, all variables arewritten out one level at a time. <p>This feature was designed to be used with NASA GCM data in the"phoenix" format. The upper air <i>prognostic</i> variables weretransposed, but the <i>diagnostic</i> variables were not. Thus an<code><i>arg</i></code> of <code>1</code> means the variable has beenvar-z transposed, and an <code><i>arg</i></code> of <code>2</code>means the variable has not.<p class="style1"><li><code><i>units</i> = -1,20</code><p>This option indicates that "VAR" and "T" have been transposed in thedimension sequence. The order is: longitude (X), latitude (Y),vertical level (Z), time(T), variable (VAR). Thus, all times for onevariable are written out in order followed by all times for the nextvariable, etc.<p>Suppose your data set is actually a collection of separate files thatare aggregated by using a <a href="templates.html">template</a>. Thenyou must use an additional argument to tell GrADS how many time stepsare contained in each individual file. Use <code><i>arg</i></code> totell GrADS the size of the time dimension in each individual file. Forexample, here are the relevant records from a descriptor file for 10years of monthly wind component and temperature data packaged with"VAR" and "T" dimensions transposed:<p><ul><pre>DSET ^monthlydata_%y4.datOPTIONS template...TDEF 120 linear jan79 1mo VARS 3 <br>  u 18 -1,20,12 u component  v 18 -1,20,12 v component   t 18 -1,20,12 temperature ENDVARS</pre></ul><p><li><code><i>units</i> = -1,30</code><p><span class="style1">This option was removed in GrADS version 2.0. </span>This option handles the cruel and unusual case where X and Ydimensions are transposed and the horizontal grids are (lat,lon) asopposed to (lon,lat) data. This option causes GrADS to work veryinefficiently because it wasn't worth it to make a big change to GrADSinternal I/O to handle this type of pathological data.  However, it isuseful for initial inspection and debugging and that's basically whatit is designed for.<p><li><code><i>units</i> = -1,40</code><p>This option handles non-float data. Data are converted to floatsinternally after they are read from the binary file. The dimensionsequence is assumed to be the default. The secondary <code><i>arg</i></code>tells GrADS what type of data values are in the binary file:<p><ul><code><i>units</i> = -1,40,1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>= 1-byte unsigned chars (0-255) <br><code><i>units</i> = -1,40,2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>= 2-byte unsigned integers<br><code><i>units</i> = -1,40,-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>= 2-byte signed integers<br><code><i>units</i> = -1,40,4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>= 4-byte integers<br></ul></ol></body></html>
