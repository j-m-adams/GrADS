<h2><b>gribmap</b></h2>

<p>
The GrADS data descriptor file defines a grid structure into which
the data will fit -- it gives "shape" to the data by identifying its
spatial dimensions, the number of time steps, and the number of variables. 
<p>
If the data is in binary format, its <a
href="aboutgriddeddata.html#structure">structure</a> has already been
prescribed. If the data is in GRIB format, no consistent 
relationship exists between the data and the grid structure defined in the data
descriptor file. Hence, the need for the <code>gribmap</code> utility which "maps"
between the GRIB data and the GrADS data description.
<p>
As <code>gribmap</code> reads each field in the GRIB data file, the
parameters for that field (e.g. variable name, vertical level, time)
are compared to the information in the data descriptor file until 
a match is found. The process continues until all the GRIB elements have been 
"mapped" to their location within the GrADS grid structure. Please read the documentation on <a href="grib.html">Handling GRIB in GrADS</a> for more details.

<h3>Usage Notes</h3>
<p>Over the many years of GrADS development, the contents of the index file created by <code>gribmap</code> have changed only a few times. Although it is not present in the user interface, there is a version number associated with the index file. When the contents of the index are different and the version has been upgraded, you will get an error message when trying to read that file with an older version of GrADS. Index files created with <code>gribmap</code> version <span class="style1">2.1.a2+</span> have a new version number and therefore they can only be read by GrADS version <span class="style1">2.1.a2+</span>. If you need to use an older version of GrADS to open a dataset with an index file created by <code>gribmap</code> version <span class="style1">2.1.a2+</span>, you must first reformat the metadata in the index file by running <code>gribmap</code> again with the <code>-old</code> option.</p>
<p>The <code>-old</code> option (introduced with GrADS version<span class="style1"> 2.1.a2</span>) allows you to downgrade the version of an index file so that it may be read by any version of GrADS. The <code>-old</code> option does not re-scan the GRIB files, it merely alters the metadata in the index file's header to match the old version. There are some cases when the <code>-old</code> option cannot be used: an index file that was created with the <code>-big</code> option cannot be downgraded with <code>-old</code> because that would require a change to the format of the <em>data</em> in the index file, not just the metadata in the index file's header.</p>
<p>The <code>-u</code> option was disabled in version <span class="style1">2.0*</span> because of the introduction of the E dimension, but has been  restored in version <span class="style1">2.1.a2</span>, so that now both the T and E dimensions can be updated. The EDEF and TDEF entries must be updated separately -- only one dimension can be expanded at a time. Reviving the update feature necessitated a change to the metadata in the index file's header, so the index version  has changed with GrADS <span class="style1">2.1.a2</span>. </p>
<p>If you have an old index file that you would like to update, first use the <code>-new</code> option to rewrite the index file with the additional metadata. The <code>-new</code> option does not re-scan the GRIB files, it merely upgrades the metadata in the index file's header.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose you have an existing GRIB dataset (a reanalysis) that needs to have its time axis extended. To use the update feature without having to re-scan all files, follow these steps:  </p>
<p>1.  Do not alter the descriptor file (yet). Run<code> gribmap -new </code>to upgrade the metadata in the index file and change the index version.<br>
  2. Edit the descriptor file to expand the TDEF size. Do not change the name of the file in the INDEX entry. <br>
  3. Run<code> gribmap -u </code>with the edited descriptor file.<br>
  4. Run<code> gribmap -old </code>to downgrade the metadata in the new index file.</p>
<p>Step #4 is optional, but it allows older versions of GrADS to read the updated data file. Without step #4, only the newest version of GrADS (<span class="style1">2.1.a2+</span>) will be able to open the updated descriptor file. </p>
