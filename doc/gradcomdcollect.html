<title>GrADS Command: collect</title>

<h2><b>collect</b></h2>
<p>
This command provides a way for station data profiles and time series
to be saved in memory as a set. The command format is:

<p>
<ul><code>collect <i>cnum expr</i></code></ul>

<p>
where <code><i>cnum</i></code> is the collection number, a value from
0 to 31, and <code><i>expr</i></code> is any GrADS expression that
gives a station data result. If <code>"free"</code> is given for
<code><i>expr</i></code>, the collection is emptied and all storage is
freed.

<p>
<h3>Usage Notes</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>collect</code> command will only work when one dimension is
varying, either Z or T. Each time <code>collect</code> is issued for a
particular collection number, the station data is added to the
collection of stations.  The order in which stations are added is
important.

<p>
<li>After a group of station profiles or time series have been saved as a
collection, use the <a href="gradfunccoll2gr.html">coll2gr</a>
function to convert the collection into a grid. 

<p>
<li>See the section of the User's Guide on <a
href="usingstationdata.html#xsection">Arbitrary Cross Sections</a> for more
information.
