This  feature is implemented by means of an interface to the <ahref="http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/grads/win32/latest/pc-dist/doc/magick/ImageMagick.html">ImageMagick</a> library.  The syntax is:  <ul><code>wi <i>filename.fmt</i></code></ul><p>where <code><i>filename</i></code> can be any meaningful file name,and <code><i>fmt</i></code> is one of the ImageMagick supportedformats: gif, bmp, cgm, eps, fax, ico, jpeg, pcx, hdf, <ahref="http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/grads/win32/latest/pc-dist/doc/etc/img-formats.htm">andmany more</a>.<p><h3>Usage Notes</h3><p><ol><li>Because it requires a connection to an X-server, <code>wi</code>does not work when running GrADS in batch mode (-b option). A similarcommand that <i>does</i> work in batch mode is <ahref="gradcomdprintim.html"><code>printim</code></a>.<li>Some ImageMagick formats (tiff, png, mpeg, et al.) are not yetsupported by GrADS. If a specified format is not recognized orsupported, the image will be saved in MIFF, ImageMagick's nativeformat. If a file name extension is <i>not</i> specified, GIF is the default. <li>Make sure no other window is on top of your GrADS graphics windowswhen issuing a <code>wi</code> command, because <code>wi</code> takesa snapshot of the current state of this window. If another window ispartially covering your graphics window, your image file will containthe combination of these 2 windows.</ol><p><h3>Examples </h3><p>To try out <code>wi</code>, display something on the graphics screen,and then at the ga-> prompt enter:<p><ul><code>wi test.gif </code> for writing a GIF file<br><code>wi test.jpeg</code> for writing a JPEG file<br><code>wi test.bmp </code> for writing a Windows BMP file<br></ul><h3>Bugs for Win32 GrADS Users</h3><p><ol><li>On Windows 95 systems, GradsHDF, the version built with the NCSAMFHDF library, has a subtle bug when reading certain 16-bit (short)packed NetCDF files (e.g. NCEP re-analysis files converted toNetCDF at CIRES/CDC). Although GrADS is able to produce a plot, itmistankenly produces very large values for a few gridpoints. Work around: use GradsNC in such cases. This problem has notbeen reported on Windows NT systems.<br><li>X Windows widgets built with gs scripts may miss/delay some Xevents (keyboard/mouse clicks). This problem appears to occur only onWindows 95; it has not been reported on Windows NT.<br><li>Athena widgets built with gui scripts: menu items become invisiblewhen selected (MI/X Server only); some mouse delays on Windows 95. <br><li><code>wi</code> has been reported to produce black and white GIFoutput on VGA systems with more than 256 colors. The workaround is towrite a JPEG image, or to change your Windows display to 256 colors.</ol></body></html>
