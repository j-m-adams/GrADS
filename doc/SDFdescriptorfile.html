GrADS can read data NetCDF and HDF formatted files, as long as the data are on a regular grid. The HDF format is very general; the GrADS interface is limited to gridded data sets that fit into the internal 5-D  lon/lat/lev/time/ensemble grid space. GrADS handles HDF4  Scientific Data Sets and (as of <span class="style1">version 2.0.a7</span>)  some HDF5 files. In order to read the data in SDFs, GrADS needs a certain amount of  metadata in order to place the data   in the internal grid space. There are three ways   to do this: </p><ol>  <li class="plaintext">Use the <a href="gradcomdsdfopen.html"><code>sdfopen</code></a>     command to open the file. This requires the least amount of effort for the     user -- simply provide the file name (or an OPeNDAP URL) and GrADS does the     rest. If you use the sdfopen command to open your SDF, then all the metadata     in the file that GrADS requires must conform to the 	<a href="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html" target="_parent">COARDS     conventions</a>. The 'sdfopen' interface does not support the HDF5 format. If sdfopen doesn't work, then ...<br>    <br>  </li>  <li class="plaintext">Use the <code><a href="gradcomdxdfopen.html">xdfopen</a></code>     command to open the file. This requires a bit more effort for the user --     you must write a data descriptor file to supplement or replace the existing     metadata so that GrADS can understand it. The syntax of the descriptor file     used with xdfopen is not exactly the same as that used in a descriptor file     for gridded binary data -- see the <a href="gradcomdxdfopen.html">documentation     page</a> for further details. The xdfopen command provides access to a greater     number of SDFs, including many that do not conform to any known standard.     The 'xdfopen' interface does not support the HDF5 format. If xdfopen doesn't work, then ... <br>    <br>  </li>  <li class="plaintext">Use the <code><a href="gradcomdopen.html">open</a></code>     command to open the file. This requires the user to write a complete GrADS     descriptor file to override all the metadata in the file. Guidance for composing     a complete descriptor file for NetCDF, HDF-SDS, or HDF5 gridded data files is given below.     Please also see the reference page <a href="descriptorfile.html">Elements     of a Data Descriptor File</a>. The 'open' interface is recommended if you     are templating large numbers of data files together, the data are pre-projected     onto a non-lat/lon grid, the variables in the file have different undefined     values, or the variables in the file have been packed in a non-standard way. The 'open' interface is the only way to read HDF5 files. </li> </ol> <span class="item16"><b>NetCDF and HDF-SDS Descriptor File Components</b> </span><p class="plaintext">The data descriptor file is free format, which means the   components of each record (line of text) are blank delimited and can appear   in any order.

Missing packed data values are assigned the file-wide     undef value and are never unpacked. <br>    <br>  </li>   <li class="plaintext">If your data file contains a variable that varies in a non-world-coordinate   dimension (e.g. histogram interval, spectral band, ensemble number) then you   can put a non-negative integer in the list of varying dimensions that will become   the array index of the extra dimension. For example: <p class="plaintext"> VAR=&gt;hist0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0,y,x&nbsp;&nbsp;   First historgram interval for VAR<br>  VAR=&gt;hist1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,y,x&nbsp;&nbsp; Second historgram   interval for VAR<br>  VAR=&gt;hist2&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,y,x&nbsp;&nbsp; Third histogram interval   for VAR </p><p class="plaintext">Another option in this example would be to fill the unused   Z axis with the histogram intervals: </p><p class="plaintext"> ZDEF 3 linear 1 1<br>  ... <br>  VAR=&gt;hist&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; z,y,x&nbsp;&nbsp; VAR Histogram</p><p class="plaintext">In this case, it would appear to GrADS that variable 'hist'   varies in Z, but the user would have to remember that the Z levels correspond   to histogram intervals and not pressure levels. The latter technique makes it   easier to slice through the data, but is not the most accurate representation.   And if you don't have an unsued world-coordinate axis available, then you still   have a way to access all the dimensions of your data<em> </em>variable. </p></li> <li class="plaintext">Some SDFs have many more than four coordinate dimensions     -- staggered longitude and latitude axes are one example. In this case, it     is likely that there will be variables defined on different grids contained     in the same SDF. GrADS can only handle one 4D grid per data file -- all the     SDF variables listed in a descriptor file must share the same coordinate axes.     Multiple descriptor files must be written to describe the varibles defined     on different grids.<br>    <br>  </li></ol><p class="item16"><strong>Examples</strong></p><ol>  <li class="plaintext"> Here is a <a href="sample.ncdump">sample output from     ncdump</a> for a file containing ocean model output. This file contains eight     coordinate dimensions and nine data variables, which are defined on different     combinations of coordinate axes. Five separate descriptor files are required     to describe all the variables: one for the velocity components <a href="sample_uv.ctl">u     and v</a>, another for velocity component <a href="sample_w.ctl">w</a>, a     third for <a href="sample_temp.ctl">potential temperature</a>, a fourth for     wind stress components <a href="sample_tau.ctl">taux and tauy</a>, and a fifth     for surface variables<a href="sample_sfc.ctl"> hflx, sflx, and eta</a>.<br>    <br>  </li>  <li class="plaintext"> The <a href="http://www.wrf-model.org/" target="_parent">Weather Research     and Forecasting (WRF) Model</a> can generate NetCDF output on non-lat/lon     grids. GrADS can read these files in their native format using a complete     descriptor file with a <a href="pdef.html">PDEF</a> entry. To extract the     arguments for the PDEF entry, you can use the global attribute values, which     describe the native grid parameters, as well as the data variables which provide     the grid point lat/lon values. The WRF model uses staggered grids, just as     the ocean model does in the example above. For the sake of clarity, this <a href="wrf.ncdump">WRF     ncdump output</a> has been edited to show only the four coordinate axes that     are relevant for the data variables used in the example descriptor files.     There are many, many more data variables and coordinate dimensions in the     actual output files. First, here is a sample descriptor file to get the native     <a href="wrfgrid.ctl">grid point longitude and latitude</a> values -- note     that no PDEF statement is included and the XDEF and YDEF statements do not     map to longitude and latitude, they are simply used as abstract grid increments.     Any one of these grid points may be used as the reference point in the PDEF     entry, this example uses grid point (1,1) with values (-125.898, 26.9628).     Finally, here is the descriptor file for <a href="wrfvars.ctl">four data variables</a>.     The WRF model is highly configurable, and also under active development, so     this example should be used only as a guideline. </li></ol></body></html>
