If <code>file#</code> is absent, GrADS assumes the default file number. <br />      <code>dimexpr&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>is a dimension expression that locally      modifies the current dimension environment.</ul></ul><p>The <code>dimexpr</code> is used to override or modify the current dimension environment only for the <code>abbrev</code> variable. Only fixed dimensions can bemodified with a <code>dimexpr</code>. The <code>dimexpr</code> can be given in grid or world coordinates. <b>An important note:</b> When you specify a dimension in grid units,GrADS always converts it to world coordinates.  In general, this conversionis done using the scaling of the <i>default file</i>. The only exception to this rule is in this case, when  agrid coordinate (x, y, z, t, or e) is supplied within a <code>dimexpr</code> as part of a variable specification. In the case of this special exception, the conversion is done using the scaling for the file that variable is to be taken from (i.e., file number <code>file#</code>).<p>An absolute <code>dimexpr</code> uses the &quot;=&quot; operator to override the currently set dimension value:<br /><code>&nbsp; x|y|z|t|e|lon|lat|lev|time|ens = value</code><br />Examples of absolute dimension expressions are:<code> x=1, lat=-10, lev=500, t=1, time=02feb1982, e=1, ens=spr</code><p>A relative <code>dimexpr</code> uses the &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; operators to modify the currently set dimension value with an offset: <br /><code>&nbsp;  x|y|z|t|e|lon|lat|lev|time|ens +/- offset<br /></code>Examples of relative dimension expressions are:<code> x+1, lat+30, y-3, t+0, time+12hr</code><p>Starting with <span class="style2">GrADS version 2.0.a7</span>, a third option is available, a  <code>dimexpr</code> that specifies an offset  from the variable's initial time: <br />  <code>&nbsp;  offt =/+/- offset<br />  </code> Examples of absolute offset dimension expressions are:<code> offt=0, offt+4, offt-1</code> <br />  Please consult the section on <a href="offt.html">evaluating expressions that contain the <code>offt</code> dimension override</a> for additional information. <br /><p>The following sets of commands will yeild the same result, which is to display the 2nd time step of a variable &quot;ps&quot;: <br />  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;'set t 2'; 'd ps'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;'set t 1'; 'd ps(t+1)'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;'set t 1'; 'd ps(t=2)'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;'set t 1'; 'd ps(offt=1)'<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;'set t 1'; 'd ps(offt+0)'<br />    </code>Note that an offset of 0 returns the 1st time step, an offset of 1 returns the 2nd time step, etc. <p>Using a <code>dimexpr</code> that contains <code>offt</code> is especially handy when your data set has multiple <a href="ensembles.html">ensemble members</a>, and the start time for individual members is not the same. In that case, an expression like:<br />   <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;'set t 1'; 'set e 1 last'; 'd ps(offt=0)'</code> <br />  will give you the first time step of all ensemble members, which may occur at different time steps in the file.     <p>Examples of complete variable specifications are:<ul><code>z.3(lev=500)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File 3, absolute dimension expression<br><code>tv.1(time-12hr)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative dimension expression<br><code>rh</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default file number is used <br><code>q.2(t-1,lev=850)</code>&nbsp; Two dimension expressions <br><code>z(t+0)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does have uses....</ul><p>GrADS has a few "<b>predefined</b>" variable names.  You can think ofthese as being variables implicitly contained within any openedgridded file.  The variable names are:<ul><code>lat <br>lon <br>lev</code></ul><p>When used, they will contain the <code>lat</code>, <code>lon</code>, and<code>lev</code> at therespective grid points, using the scaling of the appropriatefile.  You can specify:  <code>lat.2</code>  for example, to get latitudes onthe grid of the 2nd opened data set.<p><h2><a name="new">Defining new variables</a></h2><p>The <a href="gradcomddefine.html"><code>define</code></a> commandallows you to interactively create a new variable. The syntax is:<p><ul><code>define varname = <i>expression</i></code></ul><p>The new variable can then be used in subsequent <ahref="gradcomddefine.html"><code>define</code></a> and/or <ahref="gradcomddisplay.html"><code>display</code></a> commands. The newvariable is stored in memory, not on disk, so avoid defining variablesover large dimension ranges.<p>Defined variables cover the dimension ranges in effectat the time the command is issued. You may define a variable thathas from 0 to 4 varying dimensions.  The <ahref="gradcomddefine.html"><code>define</code></a> command is theonly case within GrADS where four varying dimensions is valid.<p>When <code>Z</code> and/or <code>T</code> are varying dimensions, the<a href="gradcomddefine.html"><code>define</code></a> commandevaluates the expression by stepping through <code>Z</code> and <code>T</code>.In other words, the expression is evaluated within a dimension environmentthat has fixed <code>Z</code> and <code>T</code>.  This will affect how youcompose the expression.<p>When you use a defined variable, data is taken from the variable in away similar to data taken from a GrADS data file.  For example, sayyou define a four dimensional variable:<p><ul><code>set lon -180 0 <br>set lat 0 90 <br>set lev 1000 100 <br>set t 1 10 <br>define temp = rh<br></code></ul><p>After issuing the <a href="gradcomddefine.html"><code>define</code></a> command, remember to change the dimension environment so less than 4dimensions are varying!<p><ul><code>set t 5 <br>set lev 500 <br>d temp</code></ul><p>The display of the defined variable will display a 2-D slicetaken at time 5 and level 500.<p>If you define a variable that has fixed dimensions, and thenlater access this variable, the fixed dimensions are treated as"wild cards".  The best way to show this is with an example:<ul><code>set lon -180 0 <br>set lat 0 90 <br>set lev 500 <br>set t 10 <br>define zave = ave(z,t=1,t=30)<br></code></ul><p>The defined variable has two varying dimensions.  If we nowdisplay this variable (or use it in an expression), the fixeddimensions of the defined variable, namely <code>Z</code> and <code>T</code>,will matchANY <code>Z</code> and <code>T</code> dimension setting:<p><ul><code>set t 1 <br>set lev 200 <br>d zave<br></code></ul><p>In the above display, the variable <code>zave</code> would be displayed as itwas defined, ie you would get a time average of 500mb heights,even though the level is set to 850.<p>When the defined variable has varying dimensions, and you have adimension environment where that dimension is fixed, the properdimension will be retrieved from the variable:<ul><code>set lon -180 0 <br>set lat 0 90 <br>set lev 500 <br>set t 10 <br>define temp = z<br>set lat 40 <br>d temp<br></code></ul><p>In the above example, the defined variable has a varying Ydimension. We then fix the Y dimension to be 40N, and display a1-D slice.  The data from 40N in the defined grid will beaccessed.  If you then did:<ul><code>set lat -40 <br>d temp<br></code></ul><p>The data from 40S would be accessed from the defined variable. Since this is beyond the dimensions originally used when thevariable was defined, the data would be set to missing.<p>You can also locally override the dimension environment:<ul><code>d temp(lat=50)</code></ul><p>If that dimension is a varying dimension within the definedvariable.  If the dimension is a fixed dimension for thatvariable, the local override will be ignored:<ul><code>d temp(t=15)</code></ul><p>In the above command, the defined variable temp has fixed T, sothe t=15 would be ignored.<p>N.B.: The <code>define</code> command currently supports only grids.<p>Once you have defined a grid variables, you may tell GrADS thatthe new variable is climatological, ie that you wish to treat thetime dimension of the new variable in a wild card sense.<p>The command is:<p><ul><code><a href="gradcomdmodify.html">modify</a> varname  &lt;<i>seasonal/diurnal</i>&gt;<br></code></ul><p>where <code>varname</code> is the name of a defined variable.  If thegrid is described as <code>seasonal</code>, then it is assumed thatthe defined variable contains monthly (or multi month) means. Daily ormulti-day means are not yet supported.  If <code>diurnal</code> isspecified, it is assumed the defined variable contains means over sometime period less than a day.<p>After describing the defined variable as climatological, then thedate/times are treated appropriately when data is accessed fromthe defined variable.<p>In the following example, the data set contains 10 years of monthly means:<p><ul><code>set lon -180 180 <br>set lat -90 90 <br>set lev 500 <br>set t 1 12 <br>define zave = ave(z,t+0,t=120,1yr)</code></ul><p>This define will set up a variable called <code>zave</code> whichcontains 12 times, each time being the 10 year mean for that month. Weare making use here of the fact that the define command loops througha varying time dimension when evaluating the expression, and withinthe <a href="gradfuncave.html"><code>ave</code></a> function we aremaking use of the variable time offset of t+0, which uses a start timethat is whatever time the <ahref="gradcomddefine.html"><code>define</code></a> command is using asit loops.<ul><code>modify zave seasonal <br>set t 120 <br>d z - zave</code></ul><p>The final display will remove the 10 year monthly mean forDecember from the last December in the data set.<p><h2><a name="undefine">Undefining variables</a></h2><p>Each variable defined using the <ahref="gradcomddefine.html"><code>define</code></a> command reservessome system resources.  If you no longer need a defined variable it issensible to free these resources for other use.  This is accomplishedwith the <a href="gradcomdundefine.html"><code>undefine</code></a>command. For example:<ul><code>undefine p</code></ul><p>would free the resources used by the defined variable <code>p</code>.  Ofcourse, the variable <code>p</code> would no longer be available for GrADSprocessing.</body></html>
