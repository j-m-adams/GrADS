<H2><B>set parea</B></H2><P>
<code>set parea <i>xmin xmax ymin ymax</i></code><p>

The command specifies the area for plotting contour plots, maps, or line
graphs. This area does not include axis labels, titles, etc., so if you
need to see those, provide for an adequate margin. <p>

The region is specified in terms of virtual page units. By default, the
virtual page is equal to the real page, so the units are approximately
inches on the real page. <p>

Maps are scaled to fit within the plotting area such that their correct
aspect ratio is maintained. Thus, the map will not fill the entire
plotting area except under certain lat/lon ranges. A line graph or a
contour plot without a map will be scaled to fit entirely within the
specified plotting area. <p>

By default, an appropriate plotting area is chosen depending on the type
of graphics output. To return to this default, enter: <p>

<dd><code>set parea off </code><p>

It is not appropriate to use this command to put multiple plots on one
page. It is better to use the <a href="gradcomdsetvpage.html"><code>set
vpage</code></a> command. <p>
