<H2><B>set display</B></H2><P>
<code>set display <i>grey|greyscale|color
&lt;black|white&gt;</i></code><P>
Sets the mode of the display. <p>
By default, the mode is <code>color</code>, where shading and contouring
is done with a rainbow of colors. When using a monochrome display, these
colors may not map to greyscale in a pleasing way. When the mode is set to
<code>greyscale</code>, contours are displayed using a single grey level,
and shaded contours are done using a sequence of greyscales. <p>

You may optionally set the hardware background color to <code>black</code>
or <code>white</code>. The default is <code>black</code>. <p>

Issuing: <code>set display grey white</code> gives a result on the display
that is very similar to the output produced by <code>gxps</code>. <p>
