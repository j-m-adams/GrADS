For example:</p>      <p><code> # <a href="gradcomdgrads.html">grads</a></code> </p>      <p> Before initialising the graphics output environment, GrADS will        prompt for landscape or portrait mode.  Landscape is 11 x 8.5        inches, portrait is 8.5 x 11 inches.         The actual size of the window will not, of course,  be 11 x 8.5        inches (or 8.5 x 11 inches), but instead will be scaled to fit comfortably withing your workstation's display size.  </p>      <h2><u>Startup options</u></h2>      <p>You may specify the following options as arguments to the <a href="gradcomdgrads.html"><code>grads</code></a> command when GrADS is started:</p>      <p>  <code>-help</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prints out a list of all command line options. <br /> <code>-l</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run grads in landscape mode. The Portrait vs. Landscape question is not asked. <br /> <code>-p</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run grads in portrait mode. The Portrait vs. Landscape question is not asked. <br /> <code>-b</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run grads in batch mode.  No graphics output window is opened. <br /> <code>-g <i>geom</i></code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explicitly set the dimensions of the display window at startup. <br> <code>-c <i>cmd</i></code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute the supplied <code><i>cmd</i></code> as the first  GrADS        command to execute after GrADS is started. <br>            <p>Additional command line options are documented <a href="gradcomdgrads.html">here</a>. GrADS        will always treat the display window as if it were  11 x 8.5        or 8.5 x 11 so if you use the -g option at startup, it is best to size the window with  the proper aspect        ratio.  Once GrADS is started up, you can resize the window at any time using the command:</p>      <code>ga-&gt; set xsize x y</code>            <p> which resizes the window to <code>x,y</code> pixels.</p>          <p>You will enter GrADS commands in the text window from where you            started GrADS.  Graphics output will appear in the graphics            display window in response to the commands you enter.  You will thus need            to make the text window the &quot;active&quot; window; the window that          receives keyboard input.<br />      </p>          <h2><u>Help</u></h2>          <p>Typing <code>help</code> at the GrADS command prompt gives a summary list of          operations essential to do anything in GrADS.</p>         <p> <code>ga-&gt; help</code></p>          <p> This is intended            to jog memory rather than provide an exhaustive help facility. If            the GrADS manual is not available, you can obtain info on most            command parameters by typing the command on its own.             Alternatively, we are setting up comprehensive documentation            intended to be used as a local Web facility. </p>          <h2><u>Diagnostics at startup</u></h2>          When you start GrADS you get some information about the version and configured options, then you get the GrADS prompt to begin working with data.
