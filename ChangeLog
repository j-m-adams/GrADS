    * New shaded contouring algorithm: "set gxout shade2"
      Polygons are closed, have no holes, do not overlap, and are as large and few in number as is feasible 
      Use of -1 for a color # will suppress drawing of the shaded contour, making it effectively transparent
    * Legacy shaded contouring routine: "set gxout shade1" 
    * "set gxout shaded" is now an alias for legacy shaded contouring routine
    * Support for creating polygon shapefiles with new option "-poly" to "set shp" command 
    * Support for creating polygon KML files with new option "-poly" to "set kml" command 
    * 1D loglog plots with new command "set log1d"
    * New environment variable GASHP, contains 1 or more directories that may contain shapefiles.
      GASHP delimiters are space, semicolon, comma, or colon. Algorithm is:
        1. Tries to open filename as provided by user	 
        2. Parses GASHP and prepends each dir to filename
        3. Prepends GADDIR directory (only one dir) to filename    
    * New command "set strmopts" to control streamline density plus arrowhead spacing, size, and type. 
      Support for negative streamline density values (between -10 and -1) for high-res grids. 

    Misc:
    * Mixed case ensemble names are now allowed
    * Changes to improve masked contour labeling; also now works with "set vpage"

    * Previously undocumented command: "screen"
    * Added "query calendar" command to discover calendar mode (unset, 365-day, or standard)
    * Added ":" to list of delimiters for multiple dirs in GASCRP environment variable (now same as GASHP)
    * Added "NULL" as an option for scale factor attribute name in the UNPACK descriptor file entry 
      when add offset occurs alone
    * Updated wgrib.c to version 1.8.1.2a
    * Updated grib2scan to show start/ending times for averages, and valid times for instantaneous fields
    * Handles GRIB2 Product Definition Template 4.15
    * Added aliases 'line' for 'ln' and 'point' for 'pt' in 'set shp' and 'set kml' commands
    * Added alias 'image' for 'img' in 'set kml' command

    * Fixed errors when retrieving data from a very large defined object that has more than 2Gb elements.
    * Patched memory leak when reading NetCDF attributes with lengths larger than 128
    * Patched memory leaks in cdiff(), gr2stn(), and coll2gr() functions and collect() command
    * Cannot have a leap and no-leap file open at the same time
    * Calendar mode cleared with "reinit" only 
    * Fixed big/little endian error when reading 2-byte binary data
    * Fixed bug where 2-point contour segments are not drawn in upper right corner of grid
    * Fixed contouring bug for very high res grids with vertices too close together to resolve graphically
    * Fixed contouring bug for small grids that left a gap in contour line
    * Added check for strictly increasing contour levels 
    * Fixed streamlines in areas where grid boxes are not square (e.g. near the poles)
    * Disabled erroneous vector/barb drawing in some projections (mollweide, orthographic, and robinson)
    * Fixed erroneous results from 'q xy2gr' for some projections (returns -999.9 instead of garbage)

    Supplib Updates:
    * Linked with jasper-1.900.1, g2clib 1.2.2, hdf5-1.8.7, netcdf-4.1.3, zlib-1.2.5

    * Support for grib files with time unit code 13 or 14 for 15-min and 30-min increments
    * Updated doc files in src distribution
    * Changes to configuration scripts
    Bugs:
    * fixed color selection for shaded plots: lev1 < val <= lev2
    * Default cache size set properly with sdfopen
    * Forecast hours no longer round up when forecast minutes > 30
    * "gxout stnmark" now draws reports at locations exactly equal to min/max lon/lat

2010-03-26  Version 2.0.a8

    Features:
    * Single executable called "grads" is now fully-enabled
    * Support for indexing grib and grib2 files that are > 2Gb
    * Support for reading/drawing Shapefiles
      new commands: 'draw shp', 'q shp', 'q dbf', and 'set shpopts'
    * Support for reading/writing compressed netcdf-4
      new commands: q cache, q cachesf, set cachesf, set chunksize
      new options to 'set sdfwrite': -nc3/-nc4, -chunk, -zip, -flt/-dbl
      new descriptor file entry: CACHESIZE
    * New graphics output option: 'set gxout imap' 
      Quickly draws shaded grid boxes just like 'gxout grfill', but
      the metafile is not updated so printim and print will not work.
      Useful for interactive display of high resolution data. 
    Misc:

2009-08-04  Version 2.0.a7.1
	    
    Features:
    * New interface for the HDF5 data format
    * New options for templating on Julian Day and Time axis indices
    * New "offt" syntax for variable specification to express time as an 
      offset from the variable's initial time instead of an absolute value
    * New function eloop() for obtaining E-varying results from expressions 
      that are unable to operate when E is a varying dimension
    * New option for contour labels: 'set clab masked'
      This creates gaps in the contour lines for the labels, so rectangles 
      for the label background are not drawn; contour labels never overlap.

    Misc:
    * Fixed sdfopen/xdfopen to detect only those data variables whose 
      dimensions match all of the grid dimensions
    * Added isnan() and isinf() tests at initial I/O 
	
    Bugs: 
    * Fixed bug in original release of 2.0.a7 for non-templated HDF datasets.

    Features:
    * Maximum number of user-defined colors increased from 99 to 255. 
    * New commands "set undef" and "query undef" allow the user to 
      control the undefined data value for all forms of GrADS output. 
      This affects all the undefined values printed to screen in the 
      'gxout stat' and 'gxout print' output, as well as the undefined 
      values in fwrite, sdfwrite, and geotiff files. 
      The default output undef value is -9.99e8.

      'set geotiff'         (sets output filename root and other characteristics)
      'set gxout kml'       (generates a TIFF image file and a companion KML text file)
      'set kml'             (sets output filename root)

    Bugs: 
    * PDEF lcc now works properly in the Southern Hemisphere
    * sdfwrite output has correct time axis units

    Misc:
    * Added support for templating on T but not E for self-describing files

2008-12-31   Version 2.0.a4

    Bugs:
    * Fixed function stnave(): error occurred when setting undef mask for result 
      if some reports were missing. Led to incorrect averages!!
    * Fixed function asum(): error occurred when setting undef mask for final result.
      Led to answer being always undefined!!
    * Fixed seg fault for non-templated netcdf files when X dim wraps the globe
      and other dims are fixed.

    Misc:
    * 'set frame circle' now works for orthograhic projections
    * Support for grib2 grid 204 (curvilinear orthogonal)
    * The color of a constant grid is whatever 'set ccolor' is, instead of being fixed red
    * The 'q ctlinfo' and 'q file' output is enhanced and more accurate. 
      (This one helps GDS 2.0 know when a data set is 4D or 5D.)
    * Create postscript output from inside GrADS using 'print' command without 'enable print'

  
2008-08-12   Version 2.0.a3
    
    Features:
    * New set of commands for writing out netcdf files.  
      'sdfwrite'       (creates the file, takes a defined variable name as an argument)

      'query sdfwrite' (shows the output filename, format, and user-specified attributes)
      'set sdfattr'    (sets attribute metadata for the output file) 
      'clear sdfwrite' (resets the sdf output filename and releases any	attributes)
    * Added "PDEF GENERAL" as an data-format independent alternative to "PDEF FILE".

    Fixes:
    * Station data handling via OPeNDAP (enabled with libgadap) works with GDS 2.0.
    * The stnmap utility does not seg fault when some templated data files are missing.
